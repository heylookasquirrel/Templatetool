# Templatetool
IT Service Desk Helper


After some time working at an IT helpdesk, There was a template internally that people would copy paste from a notepad. I thought there was a way to make this way more efficient so I created this in the only tool we are really allowed to use, powershell!

There is quite a bit more being implemented soon, All forms are generic to keep compliance with internal information
